### 1. [ActiveCampaign.](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/activecampaign "ActiveCampaign")

#### Best Email Marketing Software ($9/month)

![ActiveCampaign](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20750%20370%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

[ActiveCampaign](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/activecampaign "ActiveCampaign") is #1 on my list as it is the best overall email marketing software due to its advanced automation features and deliverability.

As the smartest tool on this list, **machine learning plays a key role.** With Predictive Actions, ActiveCampaign answers tough questions about your customers to automatically take action for you and lead them down the sales funnel.

ActiveCampaign also integrates with 850+ other apps like Facebook, Shopify, WordPress, and a whole lot more.

Automating your list segments is intuitive, and you can build list triggers and move users based on dynamic email content, sales follow-ups, and more.

Email workflows are robust and easy to manage. All of this data syncs with their built-in CRM to provide sales teams with advanced lead scoring.

**Their lead scoring system is flexible too.** If you’re not familiar with lead scoring, it’s a way to award points to individual email subscribers based on the actions of your choosing. Then once they hit a point threshold, they either enter a new automation funnel or can be contacted by your sales team.

**Here are the steps:** 

* First, you select your engagement metrics. These could be anything from an email open or click, all the way to a content download or consultation request.
* Next, you add your lead scoring rules and points based on these conditions. These should be set based on the level of effort and propensity to convert.
* Maybe an email open is worth two points, and a link click is worth five points. Or actions like non-opens or unsubscribes are worth negative points. Once a subscriber reaches a pre-determined point threshold, subscriber data flows to the Deals CRM where they enter a new stage of automation:

![ActiveCampaign Lead Scoring Deals CRM Options](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20570%20541%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

It’s a great system that large companies use to nurture email leads in the most personalized way possible.

**Another strong selling point is email deliverability**, ranking higher than all other platforms on this list. Their email sends are the least likely to be marked as spam and have the best chance of hitting primary inboxes on Gmail and Outlook.

**Pricing:**

Pricing is based on the account features and the size of your email list.

* Lite: $9/month
* Plus: $49/month
* Professional $129/month
* Enterprise: $229/month

All plans come with a 14-day free trial.

Overall, [ActiveCampaign](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/activecampaign "ActiveCampaign") is the best tool if you’re looking for the best email marketing, CRM, and automation tool in one place.

### 2. [Constant Contact.](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/constant-contact "Constant Contact")

#### Best Email Marketing Service for Small Business ($16/month)

![Constant Contact](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20750%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

[Constant Contact](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/constant-contact "Constant Contact") has been in the email marketing space since 1995, taking the name Constant Contact back in 2004. In 2015, they became a part of Endurance International Group, a powerhouse that other companies including [Bluehost](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/bluehost "Bluehost"), [HostGator](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/hostgator "HostGator"), and [Domain.com](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/domaincom "DomainCom").

As stated on their website, the company’s ultimate goal is to help small businesses navigate the promise, power, and potential of the web.

They feature 100+ modern, mobile-optimized templates to engage and convert customers, real-time reporting and analytics, and bonus features like coupons, polls, and events.

**One of their most unique features is [event management](https://www.adamenfroy.com/best-event-management-software)** and the ability to manage invitations, registrations, and tickets:

![Constant Contact Event Registration Features](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20788%20567%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Email deliverability is above average and one of the highest among email service providers [at over 90%](https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/email-deliverability-test/).

Constant Contact pricing is tiered based on the number of email contacts in your list. Their paid plans start at $18/month for up to 500 contacts.

Their drip campaigns are easy to use and intuitive. You can create simple sequences, but can’t combine conditions or use advanced filtering.

Ultimately, if you’re looking for niche features like event management and also want top-notch email deliverability, [Constant Contact](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/constant-contact "Constant Contact") is the choice for you. They are my #2 choice for email service providers this year.

### 3. [Sendinblue.](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/sendinblue "SendinBlue")

#### Best Email Marketing Service with Automation on a Budget ($20/month)

[Sendinblue](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/sendinblue "SendinBlue") is an easy to use email marketing service with a free plan that allows unlimited contacts, and 300 email newsletter sends per day. If you’re serious about growing your list, you can use their Lite plan which starts at $20/month and allows up to 40,000 sends per month and no daily sending limit.

Their free platform is all built on ease of use. Its simplicity allows you to easily create clean-looking templates, automated welcome emails, and website opt-in forms. They also offer live chat and CRM in their free plan, which includes one automation workflow for up to 2,000 contacts.

Sendinblue also uses machine learning and AI to send emails at the best time of the day to maximize engagement.

You can also view real-time statistics with necessary reports that provide metrics like open rates, click-through rates, deliverability, and heat maps.

One of their best features is their email automation workflows. These allow you to set triggers and put your subscribers through custom workflows based on actions they take on your website and in the funnel:

![Sendinblue Marketing Automation Workflow](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20458%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

These automated triggers create actions like sending emails and SMS messages, segmenting your contacts into separate lists, and updating their information in your database.

If you want advanced email marketing automation software on a budget, you can **get started with their Lite Plan for $20/month and save 10% on annual plans.**

[Try Sendinblue](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/sendinblue)

### 4. [HubSpot.](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/hubspot-email "HubSpot Email")

#### Best Email Marketing Software for Marketers (Free – $50/month)

[HubSpot](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/hubspot-email "HubSpot Email") is the most integrated marketing package on the market. Using their email marketing software is one of the easiest ways to design, optimize, and send fantastic looking emails. They provide a ton of custom features and you can pick and plan and upgrade whether you’re a small business or large enterprise.

When creating an email, you either use one of their pre-made email templates or start from scratch. These templates allow you to add text, images, buttons, dividers, and all different kinds of assets and layouts.

I found their email editor the easiest to use on the market. It’s much faster and more user-friendly than other tools on this list:

[![HubSpot Email Marketing Dashboard](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/hubspot-email)

Once you’re happy with your email design, preview it based on different recipients, devices, or email clients like Gmail, Apple Mail, and Office 365.

This tool is super useful. Email subject lines, preview text, and the content itself can look very different based on the end user’s email client. These previews ensure your emails look great in any inbox.

Personalization is another strength with HubSpot. Like standard tools, you personalize content based on common merge tags like the recipient’s first name. HubSpot takes it a step further.

You can also personalize content based on a user’s device, list segment, and geographic location. Plus, you can A/B test your subject lines and content to make sure you maximize your email open rates and click rates.

Next, when you’re ready to hit send and publish your email, you can use their *Smart Send* functionality. This feature allows you to adjust your send time to maximize engagement.

After sending your email, it’s time to view your metrics. The HubSpot analytics dashboard gives you data on your opens and clicks, plus unique information on **the amount of time spend viewing your email.** 

Viewing whether subscribers *Read, Skimmed,* or *Glanced* at your email is one of the best reporting tools to observe how engaging your email content is:

![HubSpot Email Marketing Analytics Report](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20450%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

For example, you may see that subscribers are only glancing at your emails for a short time. This data helps you know which types of email content need to be improved.

Consistently hitting users’ inboxes is another benefit with HubSpot. They have a healthy **99% email deliverability rate.** These substantial numbers are due to proper domain validation settings with DKIM and SPF records, plus the ability to thoroughly preview and test emails.

The main reason that HubSpot is #1 on my list is that their email marketing platform is just one aspect of their product. The real benefits come with their **Marketing Hub Starter Package**.

This full marketing platform includes email marketing and everything else to align your marketing and sales efforts:

* Full-featured CRM
* Automated sequences
* Mobile optimization
* Personal calendar to schedule appointments
* Gmail extensions to track email sends and automate outreach
* Form builders
* Inbound lead, email, and ad analytics
* Phone and email support

[HubSpot](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/hubspot-email "HubSpot Email") is my #3 pick for the best email marketing software for one simple reason: It perfectly aligns your inbound and outbound marketing in the most efficient way possible.

**I recommend you get started for free, then upgrade to their Marketing Hub Starter Package for $50/month.**

![Moosend Home Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20346%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pricing for Moosend is based on the number of subscribers in your email list. They provide a free plan for users with under 1,000 subscribers and includes sign-up forms, reporting, and the ability to send unlimited emails. 

Moosend paid plans begin at $8 per month and scale up with the number of subscribers. Every paid plan comes with access to transactional emails, page builders, and SMTP servers. Their enterprise plans provide migration and onboarding support, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).

Additionally, they offer pretty advanced email sequences based on both site actions and actions within emails. Their advanced triggers make for some excellent list segmentation options:

![ConvertKit Features Email Sequences](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20423%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

ConvertKit is also a strong pick for a few main reasons:

**Get started with [ConvertKit](https://www.adamenfroy.com/recommends/convertkit "ConvertKit") – my top choice for bloggers.**

They make it easy to manage your lists with any rules you create automatically. Additionally, with their marketing automation tools, you can create an autoresponder workflow based on actions like email opens, link clicks, site visits, and purchases.

## What is Email Marketing?

A simple email marketing definition is the use of email to promote products or services. Even better, email marketing is a way to use email to nurture and develop relationships with your email subscribers to complete an end goal like a sale.

Email marketing is just one form of digital marketing, which also includes things like search engine marketing, social media, SEO, blogging, etc.

Before email, [direct mail](https://www.adamenfroy.com/best-direct-mail-services) was a way to reach consumers in their mailbox. Email marketing takes this strategy online by sending messages to users electronically to their email inbox. Unlike direct mail, email requires a user to opt-in to your email list to receive your messages.

## How Do You Choose the Best Email Marketing Software? \[Infographic]

![How to Choose the Best Email Marketing Software Infographic](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20493.842202318%204999%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

## How Does Email Marketing Software Work?

Email marketing software (or e-mail marketing) is using online platforms to send out bulk marketing email messages to your list of subscribers. This tactic allows you to acquire new customers better, enhance relationships, and encourage customer loyalty.

With email marketing campaigns, you can quickly and easily reach your audience exactly where they are without having to pay for expensive advertising space on Google or Facebook.

### **3. Dynamic content.**

You can use merge tags in your emails to customize them for each member of your email list, by dynamically changing.

### **4. List segmentation.**

The longer you engage with your email list, the more data you collect, including open rates, interests, purchase history, and more.

### **5. Analytics dashboard.**

E, including open rates, click-through rates, purchases, and more.

### **6. Advanced features.**

## What Are the Benefits of Email Marketing Platforms?

Email marketing is crucial because it is one of the best ways to build a loyal following, generate revenue, and find users where they hang out – their inbox.

When a user opts-in to your email list, they have shown interest in your business and are ready to receive your messages. Since [74% of buyers](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/word-of-mouth-marketing/#word-of-mouth-marketing-statistics) identify word of mouth as influencing their purchasing decisions, email is a natural extension of that ability to collect and share information that’s important to them.

Additionally, if you’re in sales, email is the [third most influential](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics) source of information for B2B audiences behind only personal workplace connections and recommendations from industry thought leaders.

By choosing the best email service, you cost-effectively send messages at scale, speak to warm leads without cold email outreach, and don’t pay a fee outside of your monthly subscription.

**Here are more benefits of using email marketing services:**

* Email marketing is cost-effective and has a proven ROI (every dollar spent can create a [$44 return](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics) on investment)
* Ease of use and pre-designed email designers make creating stunning and mobile-friendly emails a breeze
* Email is one form of multi-channel marketing that builds customer loyalty and brand awareness
* You reach your customers exactly where they are – their inbox
* Email allows marketers to reach their audience with relevant, personalized, dynamic messages – [74% of marketers](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2017/08/15-email-personalization-stats-might-surprise-you/) say personalization increases customer engagement.
* Automated emails like abandoned cart emails, [welcome emails](https://designmodo.com/welcome-emails/), and post-purchase emails allow you to generate incremental revenue with little work or time required
* Email marketing options are endless and you can find easy-to-use tools whether you’re a small business or large enterprise.

## What Are Some Email Marketing Best Practices?

Email marketing isn’t as simple as writing a message and sending it to a list of contacts. There are a lot of email marketing best practices to follow and email marketing industry benchmarks to hit.

Here are some of the top email marketing best practices to be successful this year:

### 1. Do Not Use Purchased Email Lists.

Email marketing is so effective because people want to engage with your business and receive your message. Buying email lists takes away this trust by spamming their inbox with something they don’t want.

And the penalties for not following these rules are severe. According to Keap (formerly Infusionsoft), you can be [fined up to $16,000](https://keap.com/product/email-campaigns) per incorrect email under the [CAN-SPAM Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003).

The health of your email campaigns depends on a healthy open rate. If you are interacting with a purchased list, you’re bound to have super-low open rates, spam complaints, and can even be blacklisted.

With the recent [General Data Protection Guarantee (GDPR)](https://eugdpr.org/) rollout, it bears repeating – never purchase email lists. You should also clean your email list regularly to ensure your contacts are up to date.

### 2. Personalize Content with Merge Tags.

An email titled, “Dear {first name}” is much more personal than “Dear Member.” Any piece of data that you collect from your email subscribers should be used to personalize the content they receive.

If the item fits in a column within a CSV file next to their email address, a merge tag can fire. A merge tag is a piece of ESP-specific code that allows you to place unique pieces of user data from your email list into your emails.

First and last names are the most popular merge tags at an email marketer’s disposal. Plus, you can use other cards like company name, date of the previous visit, the number of emails opened, products purchased, or information from a survey.

Using merge tags in your initial greeting is a great place to start making your email more personal.

### 3. Write Compelling Subject Lines.

Email subject lines should be concise, compelling, and create a sense of urgency while providing enough information, so the user knows what they’re opening. Sound confusing? Don’t worry – it isn’t.

Subject lines should be between 30 and 50 characters (many email providers cut off subject lines more extended than that). They should cut through the noise and entice users to act. The use of numbers and symbols, well-thought-out emojis, and exciting offers and discounts will increase your open rates.

### 4. Use a Welcome Email Series for New Subscribers.

Email automation is a powerful tool most often used in a series of emails that welcome new subscribers into the list. These free autoresponder emails send automatically when new users opt-in to your list.

You can time these emails so that your subscribers get them on day one, day three, day five, or even day ten. Only you know the correct cadence for these emails based on your business goals.

For example, an e-commerce website may offer a 10% discount on the first welcome email. For emails 2 and 3, they can further showcase their brand story, product catalog, and social media accounts. A welcome email series is great because it runs on autopilot, engages your list, and nurtures prospects into customers.

### 5. Format Your Emails Properly.

Emails should be between 500 and 600 pixels wide – any wider than that and users may have to scroll horizontally on their mobile devices.

Never make your “from” email address a “no-reply” email, like noreply@adamenfroy.com. Make it a name your subscribers will instantly recognize.

Place your main marketing message and call to action (CTA) above-the-fold so that most of your users will see it right away.

In your email content and imagery, stick to three fonts or less, and make sure the design matches the look and feel of your brand. Finally, put your logo at the top of the email so that subscribers recognize your brand at first glance.

The timing of your email sends depends on your customer data and your individual business type.

For example, Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to have the best engagement, with more people apt to open, read, and click your emails. Also, 8 am and 4 pm tend to be the best times of the day to send email messages.

**How Do You Optimize Email Campaigns?**

 

To optimize your emails and improve engagement, you need to conduct A/B testing and view analytics reports to improve your numbers.

You should always test one variable at a time to understand how your data reacts. For example, you can conduct a test on the time of day, email subject lines, customer segment, the content of the email, the imagery used, and the call-to-action.

Once you formulate a hypothesis on what to test, view your reports, and see how the changes impact your open rates, click rates, unsubscribers, and sales.

## Summary

That’s a wrap. I hope this list of top email service providers helps you choose the right platform for your online business.

Focus on price, deliverability, template designs, ease of use, and the unique features you need.
